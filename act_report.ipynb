    "WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",

    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tweets over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start from looking at how many tweets we have and from which period they come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/tweetsovertime.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the tweets we have come from the beginning of 2016. Then, the number of tweets gradually decreases. We can suppose that at the beginning, WeRateDogs account created more tweets trying to gain popularity. Once it became popular, the number of tweets fell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tweets by source\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also have a look at the source of tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/source.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to see that almost all tweets were created from the iPhone app and only a fraction from the web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dog names\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tweet gives us a lot of information. One of them is a dog name. Thanks to this, we can easily see which dog names are the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/dogname.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the above word cloud, Charlie, Cooper, Lucy, Oliver, Tucker, and Penny are the most popular dog names :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dog types\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs classifies dogs into one of four stages: doggo, pupper, puppo, and floof(er). The detail description of each stage is provided below. Let's check how many dogs we have for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/dogtionary-combined.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the plot below, we can say that Pupper is the most common dog category, followed by Doggo, while Floofer is very rare.\n",

    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/dogstage.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dog breeds\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting information is the dog breed. This information comes from the image predictions file, which we merged with the tweeter archive at the end of the cleaning section. Dog breeds were generated by running images through the neural network that can classify breeds of dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/25breeds.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Pembroke, and Chihuahua are leading! Now let's check if any specific dog breed gets a higher rating than others.\n",

    "### Rating\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/breedrating.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest rated dog breed is Bouvier Des Flandres, followed by Saluki and Briard. Now, let's see how the most common breeds are rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/breedrating2.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rating of the most popular dog breeds varies from breed to breed. The most popular Golden Retriever has quite high raring, however very popular Pugs are rated much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand WeRateDogs rating system a bit better!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Favorites and Retweets\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because [\"they're good dogs Brent.\"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent). Let's have a closer look!\n",

    "  <img src=\"img/ratingovertime.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the account activity, the lower ratings were more frequent. With the elapse of time, less and less dogs received a low rating, and more and more high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting thing to check if a relation of rating to retweets and favorites.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/retweetsbyrating.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the above plot, tweets with high ratings are often retweeted. Let's see if the same relationship exists for favorites.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/favoritesbyrating.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here again, we see that the higher rating links with more favorites. Retweets and favorites and generally very interesting, so now we look closer at these two.\n",

    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/favorites.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the posts get less than 11k favorites (75% quartile). The average number of favorites is 9233.\n",

    "The most popular tweet had 132810 favorites. Let's see that tweet:\n",

    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/favoritesovertime.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see an upward trend in the number of favorites. We can suppose that tweets were getting more and more favorites as WeRateDog account was becoming more and more popular. Now, let's look at retweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/retweets.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the tweets get less than 3k retweets (75% quartile). The average number of retweets is 2817. The most popular tweet had 79515 retweets. Let's see that tweet:\n",

    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/retweetsovertime.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of retweets seems to be quite constant, with a slight increase in recent years. Now let's look at the retweets and favorites relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"img/Favoritesretweetsrelation.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plot above, we see correlations between the values. This relationship will be even more evident if we use log10.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "After using log10, the correlation very visible. The more retweets the more favorites a tweet has.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs is extremely popular Tweeter account. Its popularity is growing over time and more and more tweets are being retweeted or added to favorites. Unusual rating system seems to be a good way to attract visitors."
